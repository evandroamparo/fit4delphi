#summary Current status of project.

= Details =

Project is working, all main fixtures are implemented (RowFixture, ColumnFixture, ActionFixture). 

Some parts in code needs review and update (marked as *TODO*)

Still _decorators_ and examples are not implemented

_ SummaryFixture _ is not reporting 'run elapsed time'. To fix this we need to add base class for TCounts, TStrings, TRunTime which is providing _toString_ method.
